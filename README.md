# HR_ML
Machine Learning Exploration on HR data
This project is a one off to see if it is possible to predict attrition based on general captured HR data. Data used is clearly sensitive and cannot be loaded publicly. The data we use is also masked for PII/sPII and aggregated for privacy. There is a limited amount of data collected by HR and even less that translates to something a ML algorithm can use. Will test various algoritms and post the code to this repository.
